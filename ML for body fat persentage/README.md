# Predicting the body fat percentage based on classic anthropometric traits using an explainable machine learning algorithm

[This fileThis file](Model_creating.ipynb) content python code to create models for calculate body fat persentage based on anthropometric features.

Here you can find final models for [men](last_version_26.01_model_m_904_.bin) and [women](last_version_26.01_model_w_906_.bin).
